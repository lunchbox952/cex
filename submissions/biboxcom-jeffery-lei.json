Contacted Support, that stated they were resolving an issue regarding COVER tokens. \nWaited 1 week still nothing, whent to check my COVER balance, wallet was removed. I has an uneased feeling I was being duped, my Cover balance was transfered to SAFE token wallet. Contacted again, they stated that the commissioner was reviewing the issue.\nContacted 1 week later, my inicial amount I used to purchase Cover was back on my wallet and no COVER tokens to be seen. All in all I had lost around 2500$ and they told me it was the best they could do.",
